# Changelog

- 0.3.1 (2026-02-01)
  * Adds SPECIALIZE pragmas for IO and ST to improve the generated Core.

- 0.3.0 (2026-02-01)
  * This backwards-incompatible version changes the "bring your own HMAC
    function" design and simply provides specialized DRBGs for
    HMAC-SHA256 and HMAC-SHA512, respectively. These HMAC functions are
    provided by ppad-sha256 and ppad-sha512.

  * The rationale here is to provide better security guarantees around
    the DRBG state. Now, the DRBG state is restricted to a single, pinned,
    heap-allocated mutable buffer; components of it are /never/
    allocated anywhere else on the heap during DRBG operation (not even
    in temporary, to-be-GC'd bytestrings). A new 'wipe' function is also
    exposed for explicitly zeroing out state when one is finished
    generating bytes from the DRBG.

  * Aside from the increased security guarantees, DRBG performance is
    dramatically improved, and other heap allocation dramatically
    limited, compared to previous versions.

- 0.2.1 (2026-01-10)
  * Simply adds bounds to the ppad-sha{256,512} dependencies in the test and
    benchmark suites.

- 0.2.0 (2026-01-10)
  * In order to better-match the spec, 'gen' now returns an
    'Either Error BS.ByteString'. The new 'Error' value is returned
    either in the exceptionally rare case that the DRBG needs a reseed
    (previously this was just "error <msg>"), or, more likely to occur
    in practice, if more than 65536 bytes are requested from the DRBG at
    a time.

- 0.1.3 (2025-12-28)
  * Adds an 'llvm' build flag and tests with GHC 9.10.3.

- 0.1.2 (2025-02-06)
  * Minor bytestring optimizations for shaving off microseconds in
    certain cases.

- 0.1.1 (2024-10-07)
  * Add a basic placeholder 'Show' instance for the DRBG type.

- 0.1.0 (2024-10-05)
  * Initial release.

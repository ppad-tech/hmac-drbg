# Changelog

- 0.2.1 (2026-01-10)
  * Simply adds bounds to the ppad-sha{256,512} dependencies in the test and
    benchmark suites.

- 0.2.0 (2026-01-10)
  * In order to better-match the spec, 'gen' now returns an
    'Either Error BS.ByteString'. The new 'Error' value is returned
    either in the exceptionally rare case that the DRBG needs a reseed
    (previously this was just "error <msg>"), or, more likely to occur
    in practice, if more than 65536 bytes are requested from the DRBG at
    a time.

- 0.1.3 (2025-12-28)
  * Adds an 'llvm' build flag and tests with GHC 9.10.3.

- 0.1.2 (2025-02-06)
  * Minor bytestring optimizations for shaving off microseconds in
    certain cases.

- 0.1.1 (2024-10-07)
  * Add a basic placeholder 'Show' instance for the DRBG type.

- 0.1.0 (2024-10-05)
  * Initial release.
